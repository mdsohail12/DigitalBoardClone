1.The DigitalBoard Clone is a web application I've been developing using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Its main purpose is to make note-taking and expressing ideas creatively a breeze. With this app, users can effortlessly draw, erase, and even undo or redo their actions in real-time. It features handy sticky notes for jotting down quick thoughts and allows you to download your creations. I've utilized the Canvas API and Socket.IO to make drawing together with others possible, creating a collaborative note-taking environment. To make it user-friendly, I've added local storage functionality, ensuring your work is saved, and you can seamlessly continue from where you left off. Working on this project has taken me a few days, and I've not hesitated to reach out to my senior friends for guidance. I believe in learning through collaboration and have no reservations about seeking help when needed. This project is a blend of traditional note-taking and modern collaborative technology, offering a practical tool for note-takers, brainstormers, and those engaged in rough work.
